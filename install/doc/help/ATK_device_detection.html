<h1>ATK Device Detection</h1>

If a phone is supported by ATK, it will be automatically detected when plugged with USB cable. 
A "device detection" button is displayed on ATK Test manager (and also on script recorder, with exactly the same behaviour) :

<br/>

<br><br>

By default, this button displays the first device detected or "No phone" if no phone is connected. The phone displayed
	will be the one used to record or run the tests.<br/><br/>



If more than one phone is connected, click on the button to make the "Connected devices" panel appear :<br/>

<br><br>

The list of the phones detected by ATK is displayed. Click on a phone line to select it (the "device detection" button will 
display the name of the new selected device).

A phone can have different statuses :
<ul>
	<li><b>AVAILABLE</b></li>, means that the phone is connected and available for tests
	<li><b>BUSY</b></li>, means that the phone is connected but its COM port is already used by another application. If a device is busy,
	running any test will fail. Find and close the other application using the phone, so that it becomes AVAILABLE for test.
	<li><b>FAILED</b></li>, means that the phone is connected, but the last recording or test run has failed.
    <li><b>DISCONNECTED</b></li>, means that the <b>selected</b> phone has been disconnected (if an unselected phone is disconnected, it will just
	disappear from the list). 

</ul>

    
When the selected device status is AVAILABLE, the phone icon screen displayed in the "Device detection" button is blue, otherwise it
is red :<br/><br/>
