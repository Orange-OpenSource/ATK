/**
 * This class is responsible for monitoring the status of a download session. A
 * user will typically create an instance of Downloader as well as an instance
 * of DownloadMonitor. The user will start the Downloader object, as an
 * independant thread, then call the DownloadMonitor.waitForEnd() method, which
 * is blocked until the status is changed to something else than DLOAD_ONGOING.
 * When created, the Downloader thread is passed a pointer to its
 * DownloadMonitor, to keep it informed of the evolution of the session's
 * status.
