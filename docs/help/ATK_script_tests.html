<p>Adding scripts to the check-list</p>

A <b>check-list</b> is a set of test scripts files that is managed by the ATK Test Manager. This list is 
displayed in the tab window.<br/>

There are different ways to add scripts into the current check-list :
<ul>
	<li></li>Drag and drop your test script files from your explorer to the ATK tab window.
	
	<li></li>Click on the <img src="images/ATK_add_button.png" align="bottom"></img> button and indicate the path
	to the test script you want to add (the script file can be either on your computer or on a web server).
	
	<li></li>Open the File > Add directory... menu or click on the <img src="images/ATK_add_dir_button.png" 
		align="bottom"></img> button. Indicate the path to a directory containing tests scripts files. 
		All the tests files under this directory will be added to the current check-list.<br/><br/>
	
	<li></li>Open the File > Add check-list... menu. Indicate the path to an already saved .mcl check-list file. 
		All the files defined in the check-list will be added to the current check-list.
</ul>

<p>Saving and loading a check-list</p>
In order to <b>save</b> the current check-list open the File > Save (or Save as...) menu or click on the <img src="images/ATK_save_button.png" 
        align="bottom"></img> (or <img src="images/ATK_saveas_button.png" align="bottom"></img>) button. Indicate the path and name
		of the .mcl file where will be saved the current check-list description.<br/><br/>

In order to <b>load</b> a check-list, open the File > Open... menu or click on the <img src="images/ATK_open_checklist_button.png" 
	align="bottom"></img> button. Indicate the path to an already saved .mcl check-list file. All the files defined in the check-list will replace the current check-list.

<p>Phone monitoring configuration</p>

Once your check-list is ready, you must select a configuration for each test script. This will define which
resources (cpu, memory, storage ...) or process will be measured during the test, and what will be displayed
 in the resulting graphs.<br/>

<br><br>
    
In the "Monitoring Config" column, click on a case to make the selection list appear, and select the good 
configuration for your test. Some default configuration files are proposed for specific phone platforms (android,
se, nokia, samsung), they might suits for most of the tests. But you can create your own configuration by selecting
"Create a new config file ..." in the list. The configurations are saved into XML files.<br/><br/>

At any time, you can double-click on a .xml file name to make the configuration wizard appear. It will enable you
to modify the selected configuration. <br/><br/>

See <b><a href="ATK_test_configuration.html">Monitoring configuration</a></b> section to understand how to configure your tests with the wizard.<br/>

<p>Running tests</p>

In order to run the tests of the check-list, click on the <img src="images/ATK_play_button.png" 
    align="bottom"></img> button. All the tests of the check-list will be played on the connected phone, in
		the same order as they appear in the list.<br/>

If you want to run only a subset of the tests, select one ore more tests in the check-list and click on the 
<img src="images/ATK_play_sel_button.png" align="bottom"></img> button.<br/><br/>

While a test is running, you can click on the <img src="images/ATK_stop_button.png" align="bottom"></img> button, to stop the 
current test session.<br/><br/>

If you want to see the resulting resources measurement graphs appear in real-time during the tests, open
the Edit > Configuration... menu and select the "Real Time Graph" radio button.<br/>

<br><br>
<center><img src="images/ATK_script_test_passed.png" width="720px" alt="ATK script test passed" /></center>
<br><br>

You can see in the "Verdict" column a label "Passed" appear once the test has been passed.

<p>Viewing Tests results</p>

The first time you'll run tests, ATK will ask you to indicate the path &lt;ATK_results_path&gt; where the results will be stored. For 
each &lt;my_test_name&gt;.tst test run, a new folder &lt;ATK_results_path&gt;/&lt;my_test_name&gt;, containing
the test results, will be created by ATK. <br/><br/>

If you want to change the path where ATK will store the tests results, open the Edit > Configuration... menu and change the
reports default directory path. <br/><br/>

The resulting folder of a test contains :
<ul>
	<li>The summary report of the test in pdf (report.pdf) and html (report.html) format.</li>
	<li>The various resources measurement graph images (Cpu.png, Memory.png, etc ...).</li>
	<li>The various resources measurement values in excel files (.csv), the actions logged (actions.xml) and
		the graph configuration file (confile.xml). All these files are used by the Graph Analyzer tool.</li>
	<li>A "screenshots" folder containing all the screenshots taken during the test (if any). </li>
</ul>

In order to view the results of a test, double-click on its "Verdict" case, or select the test line and 
click on the <img src="images/ATK_report_button.png" align="bottom"></img> button. This will open the summary
report in a window :
