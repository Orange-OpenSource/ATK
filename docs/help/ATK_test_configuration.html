<h1>Phone Monitoring Configuration</h1>

Before running a test or perfornming "<a href="ATK_free_monitoring.html">Free monitoring</a>", you must specify its 
monitoring configuration file. This configuration file will indicate the list
of resources to measure during the test (Storage, Cpu, Memory etc...). For each resource, it will specify its
graph color, scale, x and y labels. This configuration file will also indicate the list of action markers 
(key presses, log traces, etc ...) that will be logged during a test.<br/><br/>

The configuration file is used by "<a href="ATK_presentation.html">ATK Test Manager</a>" to know which resources
and actions events must be traced during a test, but also by the "<a href="tool_graph_analyzer.html">Graph Analyzer</a>" tool, that enable
you to compare the various resulting graphs of a test.<br/><br/>

The configurations are saved into XML files. The first time you will launch ATK Test Manager, it will ask you to specify
the path folder where all the configurations files will be stored. It is not recommended to modify these
files manually.<br/><br/>

<br><br>

In the "Monitoring Config" column, click on a case to make the selection list appear, and select the good 
configuration for your test. 

Some default configuration files are proposed for specific phone platforms :
<ul>
    <li>android.xml</li>, for testing Android phones
</ul>

These default configuration files might suits for most of the tests. It is recommended <b>not to modify</b> them, as 
they are also used as default configuration (according to the connected phone platform) when you create a new
 configuration file.<br/><br/>

<p>Creating a new configuration file</p>

You can create your own configuration by selecting "Create a new config file ..." in the list. Indicate
the name of the new configuration file and click "Ok" :

The phone monitoring configuration wizard window appears :

<br><br>


The wizard window is divided into two or three panels :
<ul>
	<li>Device Graphs</li> panel, that displays the list of resources that will be measured during the test. All the
	possible resources for the phone connected are proposed. Click on a resource name in the list to view its properties
	(color, x and y axis labels). You can change the color of a resource, and remove a resource that you don't want to
	measure. <br/><br/>
	
    <li>Events</li> panel, that displays the list of action events that will be logged during the test. All the
    possible events for the phone connected are proposed. You can remove an event that you don't want to be logged. <br/><br/>
	
    <li>Process table</li> panel, that displays the list of single processes that will be measured during the test. By default,
	the list is empty. Click on "Add Monitor Process" button to add a line in the process table. Then click on the Process
	case to open the list of processes for the connected phone. Select the process you want to monitor, and click on the
	other cases of the line to indicated the resource that you want to measure for that process (cpu, memory or storage), 
	the color of the resulting graph, and its x and y axis labels. You can right-click on a line to make a submenu 
	appear, that will enable you to delete or add a	line in the process table.<br/><br/>
	
	
</ul>

<p>Editing a configuration file</p>

At any time, you can double-click on a .xml file name to make the configuration wizard appear. It will enable you
to modify the selected configuration. <br/><br/>
