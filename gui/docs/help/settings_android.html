<h1>Android Settings</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Enable USB connexion on Android Device</p>

On the Android device press MENU, select <b>Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Development</b>, then enable USB debugging.

<p>Insert SDCard</p>

On Android devices > 1.5, you must insert a SDCard in the phone (otherwise touch events replay will fail). Be careful : the SDCard must be inserted, 
but NOT mounted (the content of the SDCard should not appear in your explorer).

<p>ATK Monitor</p>

In order to measure resources consumption on Android device, an Android application named "ATK Monitor" is automatically 
installed and started by ATK on your device. When ATK Monitor is running, you can see a green square on the top left corner
of your Android phone: <br/><br/>
<center><img src="images/settings_android_atk_monitor_running.png" width="500px" alt="ATK Monitor is running"></img></center>
<br/>
If ATK is not running, go to the "Applications" page on your phone and launch ATK Monitor:<br/><br/>
<center><img src="images/settings_android_atk_monitor.png" width="500px"  alt="ATK Monitor is running"></img></center>
<br/>
If ATK Monitor is not installed, you can find its package under <span id="cmd">&lt;ATK_install_path&gt;/AndroidTools/ATKMonitor.apk</span> 
and install it manually on your phone.<br/>

<p>Android Debug Bridge</p>

ATK uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to communicate with Android phones. The standard adb.exe application is provided with ATK.
But some phones are using a specific ADB (an adb.exe is provided with the phone drivers). In that case, the standard adb.exe used
by ATK may not recognize the phone, and when you plug your phone it won't be detected by ATK.<br/><br/>

In such a case, open the <span id="cmd">Edit > Configuration</span> menu of ATK Test Manager, select the External tools tab. Then check the "Use
specific ADB" checkbox and indicate the path to the specific adb.exe application :

<p><a name="networkmonitor">Network Monitor</p>

ATK provides a network monitor module (available for Android rooted phones with busybox only). 
The requested Urls will be displayed as markers on the graph analyzer and on the real time graph.
<br/><br/>
To enable it check "Use Network Monitor".

<p>Android devices support</p>

If your Android device is still not detected by ATK when plugged, check that it is currently supported. Please see the section
"<a href="config_new_android.html">Configuring a new Android device</a>".
