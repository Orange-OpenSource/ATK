<h1>ATK Presentation</h1>

The <b>Accelerator Test Kit</b> is a software that emulates the user interaction with a phone, allowing
automatic testing of embedded applications.
<br><br>
During a test, ATK measures device resources consumption (cpu, power, memory etc ...) in real-time, and then 
provides graph report (pdf and html format) as a result. The ATK "<b><a href="tool_graph_analyzer.html">Graph Analyzer</a></b>" 
tool enables you to map together different sources of data graph and events in order to perform correlation.
<br><br>
Connect the device you want to test with USB cable. Then launch ATK Test Manager : select Start > Programs > ATK > ATK.
You may have to click on the "<b><a href="ATK_device_detection.html">Device detection</a></b>" button to select the correct device.<br/><br/>
There are three tabs in ATK Test Manager :
<ul>
<li><b><a href="ATK_script_tests.html">Script Test</a></b> tab</li>, that enables you to load different script tests and launch them sequentially on the device.
<li><b>Random Test</b> tab</li>, that enables you to perform random test ("monkey" test) on the device.
<li><b>MixScript Test</b> tab</li>, that enables you to load different script tests and launch them in a random order on the device.
</ul>

<br><br>
The ATK "<b><a href="tool_script_recorder.html">Script Recorder</a></b>" tool enables you to record actions performed on the mobile device 
(touch screen, key press ...). These actions are translated into script language commands, and saved into 
test script file. Other script commands can be manually added to the script to perform special actions such as taking 
screenshot, make a loop on a set of actions, including another script file etc...
<br><br>
	
As mentionned above, ATK is also able to take screenshots during a test. These screenshots are used to check the application
behaviour or state during the test. To avoid fastidious manual check, the ATK "<b>Screenshot comparator</b>" automatically
compares the resulting set of screenshots with a set of reference screenshots, and points out the failing images.
